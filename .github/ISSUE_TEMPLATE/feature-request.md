## New Microsoft 365 Developer Platform Ideas Forum

We're moving away from UserVoice feedback sites on a product-by-product basis throughout the 2021 calendar year. Later in 2021, we will leverage 1st party solutions for customer feedback. Meanwhile, please post feature requests and suggestions at the [Microsoft 365 Developer Platform Ideas Forum](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-developer-platform/idb-p/Microsoft365DeveloperPlatform). 
For more information, see [UserVoice pages](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/uservoice-pages-430e1a78-e016-472a-a10f-dc2a3df3450a).
